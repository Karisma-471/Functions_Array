# SUMMARY OF THE ARTICLES ON FUNCTIONS, CONTROL FLOW STATEMENTS & ARRAY METHODS

## From what I read from these articles, I got these highlights below:

- Functions serve as a fundamental building blocks within a program. They possess versatility, being callable, passable, and reusable throughout a program. One of its core purposes is to avoid code duplication.

- For Local variables, they are declared within a function and they remain visible and accessible only within that specific function, while functions on the other hand  can access variables outside their scope through the concept known as closures and JavaScript's lexical scoping.

- Parameters are listed within the function declaration, while arguments are values passed during a function call. They play distinct roles in function execution. We can liken both parameters and arguments as variables and values respectively. Where varaiables are placeholder, values on the other hand are the main content of the variable.

- Functions without a return statement or with an empty return statement returns undefined.

- Function names should be concise yet accurately descriptive of the function's purpose, avoiding unnecessary additional functionalities.

- Control flow statements are statements that control the order in which lines of code are executed. These control statements include the if/else statements, switch statements, and various types of loops.

- Array methods are simply the different ways to manipulate or carry out operations on arrays.
 Methods like pop() removes element at the end of an array, while push() adds an element at the end.
 Additionally, join() allows choosing a separator while converting arrays to strings, whereas toString() defaults to using a comma as the separator.
